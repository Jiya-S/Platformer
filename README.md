**Starter Platformer**

Visual assets provided by Kenny Assets [Pixel Platformer](https://kenney.nl/assets/pixel-platformer) asset pack, with gratitude. 

A platformer created with Phaser js for Game 3b. Map created using Tiled (had a bunch of issues regarding that).

A short and fast parkour where you must collect a key and unlock a lock to reach the end of this short game. Retro style audio effects are added, with the added grace of not dying if you fall due to the moving (and semi-broken) clouds. The coins do nothing (YET!!) but will be important for future add-ons to this game.
